The following scripts were written as part of a project which aimed to size blue green measures--more specifically depaving and decoupling--to reduce CSO overflow frequencies. The project started from a Infoworks ICM database of the sewer network. The following steps were carried out.
1) Make a csv file with the CSO node IDs and custom labels
2) Label the CSO nodes in the Infoworks ICM database using "Label nodes from csv.rb"
